                    <p>In order to promote its initiatives to mitigate its environmental footprint arising from its own operation, Honda divides its business activities into seven domains – from product development through end-of-life, and each domain sets its own mid-term policies and internal voluntary targets for environmental initiatives.</p>

                    <h1>PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT</h1>
                    <p>Reducing CO2 emissions is critical to the preservation of the global environment. That is why Honda is aggressively pursuing development of fuel-efficient products, but it is also why we are working to reduce 
the carbon footprint of R&D processes themselves. Taking inspiration from the motto "low-carbon development of low-carbon products," we actively strive to reduce the various environmental impacts that 
arise from product development.</p>
                    <p>Emissions from “use of products” account for approximately 80% of CO2 emissions from Honda’s entire product life cycle. In light of this, Honda works to reduce CO2 emissions during usage in all of its 
products with the following three initiatives to realize Honda’s commitment to halving total CO2 emissions by 2050 compared with 2000 levels.<br>
                    • Reducing CO2 emissions through efficiency improvements of internal combustion engines<br>
                    • Reducing CO2 emissions by introducing environmentally innovative technologies and diversifying energy sources<br>
                    • Eliminating CO2 emissions through the use of renewable energy and total energy management<br>
                        By implementing these three phases, Honda is steadily reducing CO2 emissions with three aims of ultimately eliminating them.

                    <h1>PURCHASING</h1>
                    <p>Honda purchases an enormous number of product parts from suppliers. Their cooperation is thus essential to reducing environmental impacts in all areas of our business. We created the Global Environmental Vision for Purchasing to align activities toward this single objective, and are joining our worldwide network of materials and parts suppliers in a concerted and engaged effort to reduce the overall environmental impact of our operations.</p>

                    <p>In 2018, two significant guidelines were issued to all suppliers - Supplier Sustainability Guideline and Green Purchasing Guideline.</p>

                    <p>The Supplier Sustainability Guideline was formerly known as CSR Guideline, which had been issued in 2015. As Honda is striving to become a company that society wants to exist, we have to follow the social trend to sustain our brand. Therefore, Honda updated and issued Supplier Sustainability Guideline in December 2018 and distributed it to first-tier Ppart and major General Purchasing suppliers in order to keep our suppliers informed of the brand direction. We also conducted “Supplier Sustainability Activity” by going to supplier sites to confirm the actual situation (5 trial suppliers in Thailand).</p>

                    <h1>PRODUCTION</h1>
                    <p>Another guideline which was revised was Green Purchasing Guideline. Since its initial edition was released in 2011, many relevant regulations had not been added to the guidelines (Chemical substance management in processes and CFC reduction, etc.). To reflect all those regulations, we revised and distributed the guideline in March 2019 to all suppliers, Part suppliers, Raw Material suppliers, Indirect materials, Accessories, Service Parts, Logistic and Packing Materials.</p>

<p>Moreover, we are expanding CO2 reduction activities to all new suppliers to ensure that we can achieve the CO2 reduction target every year.
